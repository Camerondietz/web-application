This is my industrial Distribution ecommerce web application

Recommended Setup for Raspberry Pi 5 Web Hosting
1. Operating System
Use: Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Debian-based, no desktop GUI)

Lightweight, minimal overhead.

Based on Debian Bookworm.

Use the 64-bit version for better performance.

Install using: Raspberry Pi Imager

🛠️ 2. Core Packages and Tools
Install essential tools:

    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install git curl ufw nginx certbot python3-pip -y

🚇 3. Cloudflare Tunnel Setup
Install and run cloudflared as a systemd service:

    wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-arm64.deb
    sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-arm64.deb

Authenticate with your domain:

    cloudflared tunnel login

Then create and configure your tunnel:


cloudflared tunnel create mytunnel
Configure the tunnel with a config.yml file to point to your local service (e.g., localhost:8000 or wherever your app runs).

🌐 4. Web Server Options
Choose one:

Nginx (static content or reverse proxy to your app, e.g., Django, Node.js)

Gunicorn + Nginx for Python (e.g., Django or Flask)

PM2 for Node.js apps (keeps them running in the background)

Example: Django app behind Nginx with Gunicorn.

🔒 5. Security Hardening
✅ Use a firewall:

    sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
    sudo ufw enable

You don’t need to expose HTTP/S ports thanks to Cloudflare Tunnel.

✅ Run app as a limited user:
Avoid running your app or services as root.

✅ Auto-updates (optional):

    sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
    
✅ Use .env or secrets manager:
Never hardcode API keys or secrets in source code. Keep them in .env files and ensure they're .gitignore'd.

🧼 6. Maintenance & Monitoring
Use htop, journalctl, or pm2 logs to monitor resource usage.

Enable fail2ban if you open any ports (SSH, etc.).

Keep your packages and dependencies up to date.

Optional Add-ons
Docker: For isolating services (if you're comfortable with containers).

Watchdog script/systemd: For auto-restarting your app if it crashes.

Remote management: Use Tailscale or ZeroTier for secure SSH access over the internet.
